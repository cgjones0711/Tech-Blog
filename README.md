#Tech Blog!
 



## Description
        For this project I have created a user friendly application where users can add articles to the webpage that are related to the technology profession or general interest in it. To function through the application a user may look at the articles on the homepage. However, to create new content or add comments they first must create a new user and then log in. Once the user is logged in they can truly experience the sites complete content.
